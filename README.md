## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Incrementing Numbers:

I can increment numerical values displayed in HTML elements using JavaScript.
The parseInt() function is used to convert string representations of numbers (possibly formatted with commas or currency symbols) into integers for arithmetic operations.

Formatting Numbers:
The toLocaleString() method formats numbers as strings with appropriate thousands separators (commas) for better readability.

Interacting with Specific Elements:
You can access specific elements in an array (or NodeList) by their index to perform actions on them individually (e.g., interacting with the first button).

Using Regular Expressions:
You learned how to use regular expressions (e.g., /[^0-9]/g) to strip non-numeric characters from strings, which is helpful when parsing values from elements.

### Continued development

Still trying to know how to manipulate the width of an element in HTML that has been defined in CSS with JavaScript.
